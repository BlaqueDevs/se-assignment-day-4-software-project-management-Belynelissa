- Agile can place great demands on developers.
- Can require more time and commitment.
- Not suitable for all projects.


# 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
- Agile is more beneficial for  for dynamic, iterative projects like software, app development, and creative endeavors where requirements evolve like App development, game design or AI systems.
- Waterfall is more beneficial for structured, predictable projects like construction, hardware production, or compliance-critical software where requirements are static and well-documented. 


# 4. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
## Ways of ensuring quality assurance include: 
- Software testing. Focuses on detecting defects in the software application.
- Automated testing. Using specialised software tools to conduct tests.
- Regression testing. Ensures software behaves correctly after modification.
- Perfomance testing. Analyses how a software behaves under certain conditions.
- Security testing. Uncovers vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could lead to a potential breach.
- Conduct reviews and retrospectives to identify areas for improvement.
- Regularly evaluate quality assurance outcomes to asses effectiveness of test efforts.
- Maimtaining high standards ensure that developers build software in a consistent and predictable way, reducing the risk of bugs and other defects.


# 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining the project scope establishes boundaries, goals and deliverables of projects. It provides a clear understanding of what is included (and excluded), ensuring alignment between stakeholders and the project team.

It contributes to successful project planning by: 
- Clarifying objectives reducing ambuigity and setting measurable goals.
- Helps determine resource allocation to meet project requirements.
- Ensures all stakeholders have an alligned shared understanding of project's purpose, priorities and constraints.
- Identifies potential challenges for risk mitigation.
- Establishes benchmarks for monitoring progress and measuring success against predefined deliverables.

## Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) 
Is a hierachical decomposition of aproject into smaller manageable comonents or tasks for easy work and management.

It is usefull for: 
- Accountability. Team members are assigned clear tasks, roles and responsibilities.
- Budgeting and resource allocation. Facilitates accurate estimation of costs and resource requirements for each component.
- Risk identification. Helps identify potential problems that could affect quality and timely delivery of projects.
- Task management. Ensures no work is overlooked by organizing tasks systematically.
- Enhanced visibility. Provides a clear view of the entire project, helping stakeholders understand its structure and progress.


# 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
## Benefits of developing a detailed project schedule
- Help in assigning resources effectively by identifying when and where needed.
- Improved time management. Ensures that tasks are completed on schedule, reducing risk of delay.
- Provides a common framework for all stakeholders to understand project's progress and timelines
- Progress tracking. Allows project managers to monitor progress against the planned schedule and make adjustments if needed.
- A well-structured schedule demonstrates professionalism and builds trust with stakeholders by showing that the project is well-planned.

## Gantt chart 
Is a visual representation of a project schedule, showing tasks, their durations, dependencies, and progress over time. It’s an essential tool for creating and managing detailed project schedules.

### Uses of Gantt charts
- Tasks visualisation
- Resorce planning 
- Milestone tracking
- Progress monitoring
- Management of dependancies
